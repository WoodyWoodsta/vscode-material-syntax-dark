# VSCode Material Syntax **Dark**

A clean, practical and darkened material design syntax theme for Visual Studio Code. Inspired by the much loved [Atom Material Syntax Dark](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax-dark).

## Another material theme for VSCode?
Yes.

None of the other material themes did it for me. Both [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax) and [Atom Material Syntax Dark](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax-dark) got it right, and VSCode deserved it too.

## Lots of things missing
There are quite a few missing bits and pieces. I'm keen to keep updating per-language scopes and colors as time progresses. Let me know if you really need something.
